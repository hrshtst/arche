;;; Commentary:

;; This is my personal configuration for Emacs. The word "arche",
;; which is an ancient Greek word with senses "beginning", "origin" or
;; "source of action", is used for namespace partitioning. I borrowed
;; large snippets of code, just substituting the prefix "radian-" with
;; "arche-", from the implementation originally written by Radon
;; Rosborough <https://github.com/raxod502/radian>. I learned a lot
;; from his elegant implementation and meticulous comments about the
;; pratical way of Emacs-Lisp. I would like to express my thanks to
;; him.

;; This file wraps the primary configuration (which lives in arche.el)
;; so that we don't have to wrap the entire file in various `let'
;; forms, etc. We put as much as possible in arche.el.

;; This allows us to instead load a different Emacs configuration by
;; exporting USER_EMACS_DIRECTORY to another .emacs.d directory.
